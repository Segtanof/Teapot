      "question": "During a CT scan, a patient reports feeling warm and flushed after receiving contrast. What should you do?",
      "options": [
        "Reassure the patient and continue the scan.",
        "Stop the procedure immediately and call for emergency assistance.",
        "Monitor for additional symptoms and prepare to manage an allergic reaction.",
        "Offer the patient water to counteract the sensation."
      ],
      "answer": "c",
      "reason": "Warm sensations are common but can indicate an early allergic reaction."

      "question": "A colleague forgets to wear their dosimeter during a procedure. What is the best course of action?",
      "options": [
        "Report the incident to your supervisor immediately.",
        "Share your dosimeter with them for the rest of the procedure.",
        "Advise them to record an estimated exposure level post-procedure.",
        "Remind them to wear it next time and proceed."
      ],
      "answer": "a",
      "reason": "Dosimeter use is critical for accurate monitoring, and incidents must be reported."
